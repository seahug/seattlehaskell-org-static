  This experimental lab-style course is intended to provide an engineering-based
  introduction to Haskell with an emphasis on producing real programs that employ
  parallelism and concurrency. The ten-session course will provide students with
  just enough theoretical background in the language to write practical programs.
  It will be suitable for people who are new to Haskell, but some experience or
  background in programming in other languages will be assumed. Students will be
  expected to bring their own laptops with a working Haskell development
  environment. We recommend <a href="http://stackage.org/">Stack</a>.
